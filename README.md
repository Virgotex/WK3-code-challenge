This App is designed to update a movie theater website with the latest information about a particular movie being shown. The code first gets DOM elements of various HTML components on the page. Then, it fetches data from the server using the Fetch API to get information about a specific movie, such as its title, poster, runtime, and showtime. The movie details are then updated on the webpage using the DOM manipulation.

Additionally, the code fetches a list of films and updates the film list on the webpage with the titles of each film. When a film title is clicked, the details of that particular film are displayed, and the information is updated accordingly.

Lastly, the code implements the functionality for the "Buy Ticket" button, which allows a user to purchase a ticket for the selected movie. When the "Buy Ticket" button is clicked, a PATCH request is sent to the server to update the number of tickets sold for the selected movie. The available tickets for that movie are then updated, and the "Sold Out" button is displayed if all the tickets have been sold.

Overall, this code provides an efficient and interactive way to update the movie details and purchase tickets for a particular film on the webpage.
